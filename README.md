## What this is

A single `.md` skill file you drop into your AI IDE. Once active, your AI becomes a senior SEO + GEO strategist that:

- Asks you **40 targeted intake questions** before touching anything
- Analyzes **3–5 real SEO competitors** across Google and Bing
- Builds a full **Execution Plan Report** and waits for your written approval
- Executes across **10 phases** — stopping after each one to report and confirm
- Covers both **traditional SEO** and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** for AI search

**The AI never makes a change without your explicit approval. Ever.**

---

## Install in one command

Open your terminal inside your project folder and run:

```bash
npx seo-geo-optimizer
```

That's it. The installer auto-detects your IDE and places the skill in the right directory.

---

## Or copy-paste manually — no terminal needed

Choose your IDE below and follow the 2-step instructions.

> 📄 **The raw skill file:** [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) — this is what you're installing.

---

### Cursor

**Step 1** — Create the file `.cursor/rules/seo-geo-optimizer.mdc` in your project root.

**Step 2** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) into it.

```bash
# Or via terminal
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
curl -o .cursor/rules/seo-geo-optimizer.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aryanpanwar10005/seo-geo-optimizer/main/skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md
```

The skill activates automatically in all Cursor AI and Composer sessions.

---

### Windsurf

**Step 1** — Create the file `.windsurf/rules/seo-geo-optimizer.md` in your project root.

**Step 2** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) into it.

```bash
# Or via terminal
mkdir -p .windsurf/rules
curl -o .windsurf/rules/seo-geo-optimizer.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aryanpanwar10005/seo-geo-optimizer/main/skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md
```

The skill activates automatically in all Cascade AI sessions.

---

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

**Step 1** — Create the file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project root.

**Step 2** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) into it.

```bash
# Or via terminal
mkdir -p .github
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aryanpanwar10005/seo-geo-optimizer/main/skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md
```

The skill activates automatically in all Copilot Chat sessions inside VS Code.

---

### Replit

Replit does not use rule files. Use this method:

**Step 1** — Open your Replit project.

**Step 2** — Click the AI assistant icon → open **System Prompt** or **Custom Instructions**.

**Step 3** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) into the field.

**Step 4** — Save and start a new conversation.

> Tip: You can also keep the raw file URL open in a browser tab and paste it fresh each session if Replit doesn't persist your system prompt between projects.

---

### Lovable

**Step 1** — Open your Lovable project settings.

**Step 2** — Navigate to **Custom Instructions** or **System Prompt**.

**Step 3** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md).

Alternatively, the installer creates `.ai/seo-geo-optimizer.md` if you run `npx seo-geo-optimizer --lovable`.

---

### Bolt

**Step 1** — Open your Bolt project.

**Step 2** — Go to **Project Settings → AI Instructions** or the prompt configuration panel.

**Step 3** — Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md).

Alternatively, run `npx seo-geo-optimizer --bolt` to auto-install into `.bolt/prompt`.

---

### Any other AI IDE or assistant

If your IDE isn't listed, the pattern is always the same:

1. Find where your IDE reads persistent AI instructions (rules file, system prompt, custom instructions, context file)
2. Paste the full contents of [`skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md`](skill/SEO_GEO_SKILL.md) there
3. Start a new session

The skill file is plain Markdown. It works anywhere an AI can read text.

---

## After install — tell your AI this

```
Read and activate the SEO & GEO Optimizer skill, then start the process.
```

That's the trigger phrase. Your AI will confirm it read the full file, then begin Phase 1.

---

## What happens after activation

```
Phase 0   Reads the entire skill file — confirms before proceeding
Phase 1   Asks all 40 intake questions (product, audience, goals, GEO targets)
Phase 2   Identifies and analyzes 3–5 real SEO competitors
Phase 3   Gap and opportunity assessment vs. competitors
Phase 4   Generates full Execution Plan Report → waits for written approval → stops
Phase 5   Executes Tier 1: all meta tags + Organization + WebSite schema → reports → stops
Phase 6   Executes Tier 2: Core Web Vitals + H1/H2 structure + Open Graph + schema → stops
Phase 7   Executes Tier 3: FAQPage/HowTo/Author schema + topic cluster + internal links → stops
Phase 8   Executes Tier 4: GEO restructuring + AI parsability + entity optimization → stops
Phase 9   Full verification checklist — every tool, every item, pass/fail
Phase 10  Monitoring setup + ongoing update cadence
```

**The AI stops after every phase, reports what was done, and asks before continuing.**

## What gets optimized

### Technical SEO
- All HTML meta tags — `<title>`, `<meta description>`, `<canonical>`, `<robots>`, `<viewport>`
- Open Graph and Twitter Cards for social sharing
- `robots.txt` and XML sitemap — submitted to Google AND Bing separately
- HTTPS, mobile-first indexing, URL structure, internal linking
- JavaScript rendering audit (critical for Bing — CSR/SPA apps are invisible to Bingbot)

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms — ⚠️ INP replaced FID in March 2024
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1

### Schema Markup (JSON-LD — all templates included in skill)
`Organization` · `WebSite` · `WebPage` · `Article` · `FAQPage` · `HowTo` · `Product` · `SoftwareApplication` · `LocalBusiness` · `BreadcrumbList` · `Person` · `AggregateRating`

### Google-Specific
- E-E-A-T signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Helpful Content system compliance
- Featured snippet optimization
- Google AI Overviews eligibility
- Google Search Console setup and monitoring

### Bing-Specific
- Exact-match keyword placement (Bing weights this more heavily than Google)
- Social signals strategy — Facebook, LinkedIn, X (explicit Bing ranking factor)
- Bing Webmaster Tools setup and URL submission (completely separate from Google)
- JavaScript rendering fix for React/Vue/Angular CSR apps
- Bing Places listing

### GEO — AI Search Visibility
- FAQPage schema (3.2× more likely to appear in Google AI Overviews)
- Self-contained H2 content blocks (AI engines read blocks, not whole pages)
- Definitive answer format — "X is Y." patterns AI citation engines prefer
- Entity optimization for LLM citation selection
- Table and list conversion for AI extraction
- Citation links to credible sources

## Philosophy

**No guessing. No autonomous changes. No generic advice.**

The AI asks before acting. Plans before executing. Stops and reports after every phase. You approve every change — not silence, not a nod, written approval only.

The AI is your analyst and planner. You are the decision-maker.
